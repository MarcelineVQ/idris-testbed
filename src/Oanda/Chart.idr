module Oanda.Chart

import Rhone.JS

-- A chart is a colection of candles, a zipper makes lots of sense for the
-- viewing of one, but what about its real rep? Seq?

-- Seq makes a lot of sense if we're wanting to keep loading data as we scroll left
-- But so does dequeue, which is basically zipper again

-- Chart needs a scale, and a timeline

-- mvc
-- seq is model
