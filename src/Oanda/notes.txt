I want to faithfully reproduce oanda types into ADTs, at least what I'll
need, and then convert them to the form I'll use when I use them. This lets
me separate concerns



-- check for dupes
select * from candle where rowid not in (select min (rowid) from candle group by opentime,granularity);

-- delete dupes
delete from candle where rowid not in (select min (rowid) from candle group by opentime,granularity);

delete from candle where complete = 0;

-- check totals
select *,count(*) as cnt from candle;
