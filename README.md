The Testbed
=====

Horros lurk here, a testbed of anything that catches my interest.

Take what you need but don't linger overlong.

Items of interest:
- ArrayFire Bindings
- PRNG Experiments
- Strongly-Typed Matrix API
- Attempts at backpropogation in CPS form
  * Which tends to saturate the floating point numbers somewhere
- Neural Net Experiments in various defunct states
- Minor use of my awuful sqlite bindings
- Example of interacting with (oanda) REST api via CURL
- Probably incorrect Random instances for various primtives number types
- A stupid and basic concurrent map for direct-and-dirty parallelization
- Barebones timing for IO actions
-
